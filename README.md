# Capstone Project: Enhancing a COmmunity Library Website
In this capstone project, we'll create a step-by-step project to simulate the workflow of Morgan and Jamie using Git and GitHub. This hands-on project will include cloning the repository, creating branches, making changes, and merging those changes back into the main branch.

#### Jamie's Work: Updating Events Page
Repeat the same flow for Jamie's work on Events Page. Jamie's work should be in the _**update-events**_ branch.

_Pull changes from the main branch into update-events before raising a Pull Request._

- After Jamie makes changes, in the update-events branch, he fetches the codes in the main branch before pushing his work.

- Merge PR to _Main branch_

The final GitHub Dashboard looks like this:
